-- ai_query_anomaly_detection.sql
-- Score the LIVE brewery stream with the registered Isolation Forest model,
-- served at the `brewery-anomaly-iforest` Model Serving endpoint, directly from
-- SQL via ai_query() — no Python, no Spark UDF. Run in a DBSQL / SQL editor once
-- the endpoint is READY (see lab2b_autoloader_model.py, Step 4, to deploy it).
--
-- Model signature: two tag-normalised features (band_pos, roll_z); the model
-- returns -1 for an anomaly and 1 for normal (Isolation Forest convention).
--
-- Note: the endpoint is scale-to-zero — the first query warms it (~30-60s), and
-- scoring the whole stream is one ai_query call per row, so a full scan takes a
-- couple of minutes. Add a WHERE (e.g. area='Glycol' or a recent reading_ts
-- window) to keep an interactive demo snappy. Validated: 137/228 GLY-01 return-temp
-- readings flagged (the live chiller-drift fault).
